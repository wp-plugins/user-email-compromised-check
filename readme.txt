Cross check registered user emails with the https://haveibeenpwned.com/ API for data breaches across a number of popular sites around the internet.

== Description ==

Simple WordPress plugin which cross checks registered user emails with the https://haveibeenpwned.com/ API for data breaches across a number of popular sites around the internet.

Features:

1. Cross check registered user emails with the https://haveibeenpwned.com API
1. Check which accounts/sites have been compromised
1. Confirm what data has been potentially compromised

After seeing numerous talks on APIs and Security at WordCamp Philly 2015, I decided to write this plugin the next day for contributor day as another contribution to the community.

Simple, lightweight and free :)
